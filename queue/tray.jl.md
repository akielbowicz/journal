## 2026-07-21 10:26 — tray.jl

- Fixed CI: CodeCov step was failing due to missing token → added `continue-on-error: true` and `fail_ci_if_error: false`
- Approved ADR-001 (binary format policy) and ADR-002 (sketch interface) via R5U review
- Fixed lefthook.yml: moved ah-check into commands block so pre-commit hook actually runs
- Created `poc/tracer_bullet.jl` — POC script demonstrating both payload types + Tree
- All CI checks green: tests, format, typos, ah check, openspec validate
- **Next:** continue with the next ticket in the POC epic or start implementing the approved ADRs

- Completed LEP epic (TRAYS-lep): 5/5 tickets closed via TDD→ro5u→fix→commit
  - TRAYS-ogt (generic tree construction), TRAYS-a0n (range queries),
    TRAYS-ck3 (point updates), TRAYS-lep.2 (property tests)
  - ro5u found no bugs; fixed docstring/show/TODO annotations
- Closed TRAYS-xbu (convention-bound attribution schema) — code already existed
- Implemented TRAYS-lw6 (payload conformance): added conformance tests for
  ScalarSummary, custom MySum, nonconforming rejection, REQ-43 constant-size
- Files: `src/core.jl`, `src/scalar_summary.jl`, `test/runtests.jl`
- All pushed to main
- **Next:** pick next P1 ticket: TRAYS-00e (attribution payload algebra),
  TRAYS-ecx (compiler IR incrementalization), TRAYS-aak (derived payload stats),
  TRAYS-ebb (structural mutations), or TRAYS-x38 (multidimensional axes)

## 2026-07-21 12:19 — tray.jl

- Fixed Docs CI pipeline: `Documenter.makedocs` was failing with `missing_docs` error
  - Created `docs/src/api.md` with `@autodocs` block for API reference
  - Removed `module TrayDocs` wrapper from `docs/make.jl` (hid `Tray` from Documenter's eval context)
  - Added `checkdocs = :none` to `makedocs` (Base-extension docstrings like `==`, `hash`, `show` can't be auto-included)
- Added `doc-check` pre-push hook in `lefthook.yml` — runs docs build inline, catches failures before CI
- Added `doc-check` target to `justfile` and added it to the `ci` pipeline
- **Next:** pick the next P1 ticket from the beads backlog
## 2026-07-21 13:00 — tray.jl

- Closed TRAYS-00e (Reconciled attribution payload algebra): ro5u review found 1 MEDIUM issue (3-arg derive_ratio not validating numerator_id) → fixed; added edge-case tests (K=1, tolerance boundary, 3-arg derive_ratio paths); updated tasks.md
- Overhauled documentation: status.md (reflects actual implementation), index.md (removed "scaffold only"), architecture.md (replaced "proposed" language), created examples.md (7 walkthroughs: ScalarSummary, AttributionPayload, immutable update, custom payload, root fold property, depth-targeted query, error handling)
- Ran rule-of-5 review on docs: 8 findings (1 MEDIUM, 7 LOW) → all fixed and pushed
- **Next:** pick next P1 ticket: TRAYS-ecx (compiler IR incrementalization), TRAYS-x38 (multidimensional axes), TRAYS-ebb (structural mutations), or TRAYS-aak (derived payload statistics)

## 2026-07-16 19:19 — testimonial.jl

- Implemented Git diff layer: `parse_unified_diff` with tests for new/deleted/renamed files, multiple hunks, path resolution
- Built subprocess runner infrastructure: workspace, driver.jl, `build_driver_command`, `AbstractRunner`/`SubprocessRunner`
- Implemented recording layer: `record_item` in IndexBuilder, MockRunner unit test, `.jl.cov` sidecar parsing via Coverage.jl
- Fixed CI: `handle_discover` default path now resolves via `@__DIR__`, fixint Pkg.test() failure
- All 9 tasks completed, epic at 34/61 (56%), CI fully green
- **Next:** `testimonial-bl6` — timeout handling for subprocesses

## 2026-07-16 21:00 — testimonial.jl

- Implemented subprocess timeout handling (`run_with_timeout`, `with_retry`) in `CoverageLayer.jl` — closes `testimonial-bl6`
- Implemented `record_item(runner::SubprocessRunner, ref)` with real subprocess spawning via TestimonialRunner driver — closes `testimonial-e47`
- Fixed driver.jl for ReTestItems API (no `files`/`names` kwargs, use positional path + `name` kw) — closes `testimonial-wah`
- Implemented `select_changed_items` and `_discover_in_file` in `Testimonial.jl` — closes `testimonial-7pe`
- Built `src/Query.jl` module: `query_files`, `coverage_gaps`, `nearest_covered_lines`, `query` with `direct_change_provider`/`unresolved_provider` — closes `testimonial-amd`, `testimonial-ekf`, `testimonial-2df`
- Epic progress: 40/61 (65%), 70+ tests all green
- **Next:** `testimonial-0zr` — `record_all` with parallel recording, or `testimonial-fgr` — unit tests for query engine

---
## 2026-07-17 09:29 — testimonial.jl

- Closed testimonial-fgr (query engine tests — already written and passing)
- Fixed pre-push hooks: added `test-quick` recipe (312 tests, ~15s), removed hanging openspec-validate-all
- Implemented `record_all` with parallel `Threads.@threads` recording and incremental cache (testimonial-0zr)
- Implemented `build_index(items_dir)` to reconstruct CoverageIndex from .jls cache files (testimonial-8um)
- Epic progress: 44/61 (72%), 312 tests all green
- CI failure on latest push (build_index) — needs investigation. Likely timeout on full test suite or Serialization dep issue.
- **Next:** investigate CI failure, then continue with `testimonial-99u` (integration test for CoverageIndex) or `testimonial-mc0` (CLI run)

---
## 2026-07-17 11:20 — testimonial.jl

- Investigated and fixed CI failure: thread-safety bug in MockRunner (race condition on captured_cmd Vector during Threads.@threads)
- Added ReentrantLock to MockRunner for concurrent push!/merge! operations
- CI now fully green: all 5 jobs pass (Julia 1.11, 1.12, OpenSpec, pretender, espectacular)
- **Next:** continue with `testimonial-99u` (integration test for CoverageIndex) or `testimonial-mc0` (CLI run)

## 2026-07-17 12:55 — testimonial.jl

- Closed `testimonial-yczs`: added `params.run_output` handler to `handle_ingest` in `Protocol.jl` per TIA-ADAPT-008
- New handler parses JSON-line test results, records per-item coverage via subprocess runner, returns `runtime_edges` (DepEdge format), `per_test_results`, and `external_inputs`
- Added 7 testsets covering response shape, field accuracy, multiple items, empty/missing/malformed input
- All 312+ tests green, push and issue close complete
- **Next:** `testimonial-mc0` (CLI run) or continue with `implement-coverage-layer` epic tasks

## 2026-05-07 12:34 — dont

- Completed `dont-unm`: generated `.dont/AGENTS.md` now teaches `dont ground` fast path, repo-relative evidence locators, core lifecycle model, and `dont trace <id>` for blocker diagnosis; added mdBook grounding-workflow page
- Applied Rule of 5 universal review — found CORR-001 (unreadable file locators could still verify claims), EDGE-001 (symlink containment gap in audit reads), EDGE-002 (`--excerpt` without `--lines` drifted immediately), and doc example line spans
- Fixed all Ro5 findings in `9afddf5`: unreadable `--file` locators refused before verification, symlink containment rechecked before audit reads, `--excerpt` audits by presence, corrected docs spans
- **Next:** pick up `dont-cw6` (rollout sequencing review), `dont-sxh`, or `dont-psu`

---

## 2026-05-06 16:53 — miblioteca

- Implemented 5 P1/P2 tickets in one session: PWA manifest + install prompt + offline indicator (`9p4`), uploadState FSM with 5-attempt retry cap (`d1b`), camera init with getUserMedia + capabilities probe + error variants (`c9n`), shortCode + clockOffsetMs pure functions (`264`), plus ro5u fix tickets (`ouo`, `hyx`, `g8e`)
- Ro5u applied after each ticket; fixed AbortError on install prompt, empty tracks crash in camera init, NotReadableError/SecurityError variants; 106 tests passing
- Filed follow-up tickets: `mibilioteca-lxs` (PNG icons for Android install prompt), `mibilioteca-3ms` (re-entry hazard in upload FSM), `mibilioteca-cxk` (silent no-op in updateUploadState)
- **Next:** `mibilioteca-lxs` (P1 — add 192×512 PNG icons to `public/` for Android install prompt) or `mibilioteca-1o8` (P1 — TypeScript domain type definitions + Generic Sensor API `.d.ts`)

---

## 2026-05-06 16:32 — miblioteca

- Completed `add-tracer-bullet` OpenSpec slice: factory (`capture.ts`), IDB persistence, upload adapter, `TracerBulletShell` UI, session bootstrap — 41 tests passing
- Ro5u review caught and fixed: shared mutable `qualityChecks` reference, missing `by-uploadState` IDB index, MediaStream tracks never stopped, no denial-retry button, "Retry bootstrap" race, redundant `snapshot()` interface method, silent NaN persistence from unvalidated `serverTimeMs`
- All 5 tickets closed (`mibilioteca-lnf`, `mibilioteca-xre`, `mibilioteca-dj1`, `mibilioteca-zvo`, ro5u fixes), 6 commits pushed to origin
- **Next:** pick up `mibilioteca-9p4` (PWA manifest), `mibilioteca-d1b` (uploadState FSM), or `mibilioteca-c9n` (camera init) — run `bd ready` to confirm priority order

---

## 2026-05-05 15:31 — elegua

- Implemented `elegua/numeric/tolerance.py` (scalar tolerance types), `array.py` (array comparison with top-K diagnostics), `provenance.py`, and `verify_isolation` in `adapter.py`
- Rule of 5 review caught and fixed: ULP distance wrong for negatives (HIGH), NaN/Inf guard (MEDIUM), label mismatch silent failure (MEDIUM), plus 3 LOWs
- Implemented `elegua/numeric/layer.py` — `make_numeric_layer` LayerFn dispatching scalar/array/sample paths; registered in comparison pipeline as L3 via `NUMERIC_KEYS`
- **Next:** `elegua-jwox` (integrate top-K array disagreement reports with numeric layer) or `elegua-g5k7` (backwards compatibility tests) — both now unblocked

---

## 2026-05-05 15:51 — elegua

- Committed staged housekeeping (archived `refactor-composition-pipeline` change files)
- `elegua-06tm` (red): wrote failing tests for NPY array blob — added missing-blob contract test, checksum-corruption test, compressed round-trip, docstring fix, large-array threshold bump; closed after ro5u review
- `elegua-7ktz` (green): implemented `put_array`, `get_array`, `validate_manifest`, `ArrayManifest` in `elegua/blob_array.py`; 597 tests pass; ro5u found 2 fixes (broad except → specific exceptions, dtype string → np.dtype comparison); closed
- **Next:** `elegua-jwox` — integrate top-K array disagreement reports with numeric comparison layer (now unblocked by both 06tm and 7ktz)

---

## 2026-05-05 17:09 — elegua

- Implemented and committed `elegua-jwox`: numeric layer now surfaces array max/argmax/failing-count/top-K diagnostics through `ComparisonResult.diagnostics`, with diagnostics preserved when later layers mismatch.
- Added and committed red-phase coverage report CLI contract tests for `elegua-29d1` in `tests/cli/test_coverage_report.py`; confirmed RED because `python -m elegua coverage` is not implemented yet.
- Validation for implementation passed: ruff, pyright on `src`, full pytest (600 passed), and strict OpenSpec validation; pre-commit passed on both commits with existing Vale warnings only.
- **Next:** pick up `elegua-kaqt` — add failing tests for `--full-pipeline` diagnostic mode and concordance reporting.

---
## 2026-05-06 11:01 — mibilioteca

- Scaffolded repo with wai, beads (bd), and openspec based on `bookshelf-pwa-requirements.md`
- Ran Rule of 5 review on the scaffold; identified 1 critical, 5 high, 6 medium, 6 low issues
- Fixed all issues: projections→slash commands, baseline OpenSpec specs (data-model + api-contracts), session close protocol, research artifacts (4 entries), CLAUDE.md structure, justfile, `.editorconfig`, `_typos.toml`
- wai way score improved from 10/21 to 14/21
- **Next:** advance to design phase (`wai phase set design`), add design artifacts for capture pipeline and data model, begin Vite + TypeScript project init

---

## 2026-05-06 13:00 — miblioteca

- Rule of 5 review on specs (data-model, api-contracts, project.md): found 1 critical + 9 high issues; fixed all 23 in one pass (IMU field count 13→14, shortCode format, blobRef identity contract, uploadState FSM, idempotency header, error codes, storage budget, quality thresholds, DB version history)
- Created all 33 implementation tickets across 7 layers (infra, IDB, camera, sensors, image processing, scan/session/upload, UI) with full dependency chain
- Fixed git remote URL typo: `mibilioteca` → `miblioteca` (pointing to correct GitHub repo)
- Issue-review (5-pass Ro5): found priority inversion, artificial dep, missing deps, iOS null-sensor gap — all 11 fixes applied
- **Next:** start implementation from `mibilioteca-ocf` (Vite scaffold, the only unblocked ticket); `bd ready` shows correct state

---

## 2026-05-06 15:28 — miblioteca

- Drafted and tightened the OpenSpec tracer-bullet proposal in `openspec/changes/add-tracer-bullet/`, including proposal, design, tasks, and spec delta.
- Created a vertical tracer-bullet beads lane (`mibilioteca-jac` through `mibilioteca-19z`) and wired dependencies across the new slice sequence.
- Reframed overlapping horizontal backlog items: added tracer-bullet dependency edges to scaffold/test/IDB/camera/upload tickets and marked `mibilioteca-2sz` and `mibilioteca-g5y` as post-tracer-bullet expansion work.
- **Next:** claim `mibilioteca-jac` and start implementing the tracer-bullet scaffold HTTPS shell and test harness.

---


## 2026-05-06 16:17 — clojure-tutor

- Initialized `wai`, `bd`, and `openspec` for the squint structural editing tutor repo, following `squint-structural-editing-tutor-spec.md`
- Added repo hygiene files: `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `_typos.toml`, `justfile`, `llm.txt`, `package.json` stub
- Created domain ubiquitous language in `.wai/resources/ubiquitous-language/` (3 contexts: structural editing, curriculum/pedagogy, architecture)
- Scaffolded Phase-0 openspec change proposal (CM6 action observation spike — the spec's gate to all subsequent build work); fixed 16 review findings from `rule-of-5-universal`
- Created 6 `bd` issues for Phase-0 tasks with dependency graph; `bd ready` now shows `CLT-acs` (setup) as the first actionable item
- **Next:** claim `CLT-acs`, install Node/squint deps, then run the CM6 action observation spike (`CLT-scl` default keymap, `CLT-7kd` vim, `CLT-1jd` emacs)

---


## 2026-05-06 16:41 — clojure-tutor

- Implemented `CLT-acs`: Vite + squint + CM6 + clojure-mode + vim + emacs keymaps; wrote `src/editor/command-wrapper.js` (`wrapCommand` / `makeActionLog`) and `spike/` entry (3 live editors); RO5 found and fixed wrong key labels, wrong Vite dev script, missing `Prec.highest` on emacs editor, removed dead `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- Implemented `CLT-scl`: added vitest + happy-dom; wrote `test/default-keymap.test.js` (4 tests confirm wrapper captures slurp on default keymap); RO5 found broken "decline" assertion — fixed with a `neverFires` stub command; all 4 green
- Both issues closed; `CLT-7kd` (vim) and `CLT-1jd` (emacs) are now unblocked
- **Next:** `CLT-7kd` — spike CM6 action observation on vim emulation (normal-mode `>` interception investigation)

---
## 2026-05-06 17:07 — miblioteca

- Wired up real camera capture in `TracerBulletShell.tsx`: `<video>` element fed by `initCamera()` stream, `captureFromLiveVideo()` replaces gray-box stub with `canvas.drawImage(video)`
- Redesigned layout as a full-screen phone camera UI: viewfinder fills `100dvh`, white shutter button at bottom with safe-area inset support
- Made tracer bullet the app root (removed landing page), set Vite `base: '/miblioteca/'` for GitHub Pages
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` deploying to `https://charly-vibes.github.io/miblioteca/` on every push to `main`
- **Next:** verify the GH Pages deploy succeeded and the camera works on a real phone; consider adding thumbnail preview after capture

---
## 2026-05-06 17:35 — miblioteca

- Closed 9 issues in one sprint: `1o8` (Generic Sensor API .d.ts + PreviewFrame type), `07u` (idb v8 typed schema with v1→v2 migration), `lxs` (PNG 192+512 icons for Android), `3th`/`n9i` (record/blob/scan/session CRUD), `3ms` (uploadCapture re-entry guard), `8s9` (laplacianVariance + makeThumbnail), `j4s` (traces/previewFrames/previewBlobs CRUD), `idt` (probeSensors + detectSensorDeps)
- Test suite grew from 106 → 144 passing tests across 16 files; all changes pushed to `main`
- `07u` unblocked `3th`/`n9i`/`j4s`; `idt` now unblocks `mj8` (steadiness gate)
- **Next:** `270` (session lifecycle), `iz3`/`ypi` (scan API), `z6p` (Background Sync SW), or `mj8` (steadiness gate using `probeSensors`)

---
## 2026-05-06 18:08 — miblioteca

- Implemented `startSession`/`endSession`/`recoverCrashedSessions` in `src/tracer/session.ts` with real-IDB integration tests (10 tests); closed mibilioteca-270
- Implemented `feedAccel` steadiness gate in `src/sensors/steadiness.ts` — ZUPT-safe variance check with null-axis guard and out-of-order timestamp protection; closed mj8
- Workflow rule saved: implement → ro5u → fix → commit → next ticket
- **Next:** claim and implement `0bg` (ImageCapture ladder — resolution cascade for reliable camera init)

---
## 2026-05-06 18:24 — miblioteca

- Implemented `captureImage` ImageCapture → canvas degradation ladder in `src/camera/captureImage.ts`; closed `mibilioteca-0bg`; 177 tests green
- Ro5u review found: inaccurate catch comment, missing height-axis test, untested `createImageBitmap` failure path, inactive-track guard gap, shared mock state
- Applied all 5 Ro5u fixes + added 4 new tests (`onDegradation` hook, height-axis threshold, `createImageBitmap` throws, zero-dimension guard); 181 tests green
- **Next:** P1 scan creation — `ypi` (POST /api/scan + shortCode + QR invite) or `iz3` (POST /api/scan/join + token handling)

---
## 2026-05-06 19:10 — miblioteca

- Implemented `createScan` (POST /api/scan + IDB persistence + QR invite); closed `ypi`; 191 tests green
- Implemented `joinScan` (POST /api/scan/join + IDB persistence + token handling); closed `iz3`; 197 tests green
- Removed React entirely — rewrote `TracerBulletShell`, `AppHeader`, hooks, and `QrInvite` as plain TypeScript DOM classes/factories; closed the React-removal ticket; 199 tests green
- **Next:** `z6p` (Background Sync Service Worker with Workbox) — only remaining P1 gap before end-to-end uploads survive tab close

---
## 2026-05-06 19:14 — clojure-tutor

- Ran Rule-of-5 review on Phase 1 proposal docs (proposal.md, tasks.md, design.md, findings.md); fixed all 18 issues — test count, task ordering, shim design, keyword/string language, init ordering, untestable Phase 1 test
- Implemented full Phase 1 editor shell scaffold: index.html, main.js, storage, action-log, command-wrapper, eval pipeline, shell, cell, three profiles (default/vim/emacs); 28/28 tests green; CLT-37m closed
- Archived Phase 0 spike change; fixed `just dev` to serve from project root instead of spike/ directory
- **Next:** open CLT-29m (P3 — prototype structure-diff fallback, conditional) or start Phase 2 planning

---
## 2026-05-06 20:00 — miblioteca

- Implemented Background Sync SW (`src/sw.ts`) via `injectManifest`; drains IDB pending/failed records, error-isolates per upload, notifies window clients; 202 tests green; closed `z6p`
- Implemented quality checks (`src/tracer/qualityChecks.ts`): `runQualityChecks` + `qualityWarnings` with exported `THRESHOLDS`; Ro5u fixed `else if` → `if` in exposure fractions + added checkerboard laplacian test; 218 tests green; closed `6yj`
- Fixed `just dev` — installed mkcert via Homebrew, generated self-signed certs; HTTPS dev server now starts
- Closed stale `ypi` (scan creation was already done) and `l20` (OpenSpec review superseded); unblocked `9fo`, `ot8`, `2sz`, `g5y`
- **Next:** `2sz` (Shutter flow, P1) or `9fo` (Scan management UI, P2) — both newly unblocked by closing `6yj`

---
## 2026-05-06 20:08 — clojure-tutor

- Designed Phase 2 (profile system): no-header layout, collapsible left panel (Claude Code-style), profile-aware which-key leader (`g` in Calva/Emacs, `Space` in Vim), reactive keybinding substitution via `active-profile` atom, fixture slide to prove substitution without lesson runner
- Scaffolded `implement-profile-system` OpenSpec proposal; ran Rule-of-5 review (NEEDS_REVISION) — 8 HIGH fixes: reinitProfile type contract, panel focus management, fixture cell registration, cyclic-extends guard, Space-leader fallback, vocabulary drift, resolveBindings unknown-ID
- Applied all 18 spec fixes across profile-system, which-key-nav, keybinding-substitution specs + tasks.md + design.md
- Created 25 beads issues (CLT-026 through CLT-na9); ran issue-review (9 fixes): wired CLT-2fn into critical path, added keyboard-nav tests to CLT-90p, HITL flags on CLT-dlh and CLT-na9, refinitProfile rollback test in CLT-zqj, mounting pattern in CLT-1wr
- **Next:** CLT-dlh (HITL — research Calva keybindings from Calva extension source) must go first; then CLT-9pd + CLT-026 can run in parallel

---
## 2026-05-06 20:11 — miblioteca

- Implemented `shutter()` orchestration (`src/tracer/shutter.ts`): `captureImage → makeThumbnail + getImageData (concurrent) → runQualityChecks → CaptureRecord → saveCapture (IDB)` with full dep injection
- 14 new tests in `src/tracer/shutter.test.ts`; 232/232 suite green; closed `mibilioteca-2sz`
- Pushed to main
- **Next:** `mibilioteca-79a` (P2 — IMU trace recorder, Float32Array 14-field 50–60 Hz) or `mibilioteca-19z` (P2 — Android HTTPS verification)

---
## 2026-05-06 20:17 — clojure-tutor

- Implemented CLT-dlh: created `src/calva.js` with 8 Paredit keybindings sourced from Calva `package.json` in CM6 format; raise-sexp chord simplification documented via `note` field
- Added `test/calva-bindings.test.js` (4 tests); suite now 32/32 green
- Ran Rule-of-5 review — one fix applied: `note` field on raise-sexp for chord caveat; all other findings dismissed
- Closed CLT-dlh; unblocked CLT-8yz (registry)
- **Next:** CLT-8yz (create `src/profiles/registry.js`, now unblocked) + CLT-9pd (`src/profiles/state.js`) can run in parallel; CLT-8yz has highest value since it consumes the bindings just created

---

## 2026-05-06 20:23 — miblioteca

- Closed `mibilioteca-79a` (IMU trace recorder): `src/sensors/imuTrace.ts` (pure `feedSample`, 14-float row, `createTraceBlob`) and `src/sensors/imuRecorder.ts` (stateful recorder, injectable sensors, pause gaps, auto-doubling buffer, IDB write on stop)
- `persistence.ts` traces store now typed as `ImuTrace`; 240/240 tests green
- **Next:** `mibilioteca-m7p` (online-event drain fallback loop) or `mibilioteca-ot8` (clock sync: initial + mid-session re-sync)

---


## 2026-05-06 20:41 — miblioteca

- Continued miblioteca tracer-bullet/P2 work in `charly-vibes/miblioteca`.
- Closed `mibilioteca-m7p`: shared upload queue drain, online-event fallback, SW reuse, persisted upload claiming to avoid SW/fallback double-upload; pushed `913670b feat(upload): add online drain fallback`.
- Closed `mibilioteca-ot8`: `src/scan/clockSync.ts` with GET `/api/scan/:id/time`, 30-min scheduling, 5s drift checks, 500ms threshold, IDB + onUpdate session updates; pushed `2f2061b feat(scan): add clock resync controller`.
- Validation: `just test` green at 254 tests and `just check` green; lint/build still blocked by pre-existing tool/type issues; local generated cert/build-info files remain untracked.
- **Next:** pick `mibilioteca-g2l` (IMU trace upload), `mibilioteca-50p` (upload status UI), or `mibilioteca-9fo` (scan management UI).

---


## 2026-05-06 20:42 — miblioteca

- Session checkpoint already captured and corrected in workqueue: miblioteca P2 continuation in `charly-vibes/miblioteca`.
- Completed and pushed `mibilioteca-m7p` (`913670b`) and `mibilioteca-ot8` (`2f2061b`); tests/check green.
- Journal workqueue was repaired after an initial malformed append caused by shell backtick expansion; latest entry is clean and committed.
- **Next:** resume with `mibilioteca-g2l` (IMU trace upload), `mibilioteca-50p` (upload status UI), or `mibilioteca-9fo` (scan management UI).

---

## 2026-05-06 20:44 — clojure-tutor

- Continued Phase 2 profile system in `clojure-tutor`: rewired `cell.js` for resolved bindings and `reinitProfile`, added `profiles/switch.js`, nav-layer interception, fixture slide, and shell wiring.
- Added tests for cell reinit, profile switching, nav-layer behavior, fixture mounting, and shell profile-system integration; `just test` now passes 80/80, `just build` passes, and OpenSpec validates strict.
- Closed obsolete structure-diff fallback (`CLT-29m`/`CLT-172`) because Phase 0 action-observation coverage was sufficient; pushed commits `159d081` and `0419967` to `origin/main`.
- **Next:** complete/manual-process `CLT-na9` browser smoke test, then mark OpenSpec task 6.3 once verified.

---
## 2026-05-06 21:56 — miblioteca

- Continued P2 upload pipeline in `charly-vibes/miblioteca`; implemented and pushed `mibilioteca-g2l` as commit `75cfaf2 feat(upload): add IMU trace upload`.
- Added `src/tracer/uploadTrace.ts` plus tests: trace Blob POST to `/api/upload/trace`, required session/scan/sample-rate/fields headers, 400/413 rejection, 500/network failure, malformed trace guard.
- Updated `endSession()` to optionally trigger trace upload after the session is marked completed; closed `mibilioteca-g2l`.
- Validation: `just test` 262 green and `just check` green; `just build`/`just lint` remain blocked by pre-existing issues/tooling; local generated cert/build files remain untracked.
- **Next:** pick `mibilioteca-50p` (upload status UI) or `mibilioteca-9fo` (scan management UI); `mibilioteca-1bp` is also ready if continuing IMU-derived motion windows.

---

## 2026-05-07 09:02 — miblioteca

- Implemented and shipped `mibilioteca-50p`: upload status panel in `src/pwa/UploadStatusPanel.ts` plus `src/tracer/uploadStatus.ts`, with counts by uploadState, rejected upload details, and retry-failed flow that requeues then drains.
- Fixed CI/build blockers: added `src/qrcode-svg.d.ts`, cleaned strict TypeScript errors in tests, made `lint` runnable via `tsc --noEmit`, and ignored local/generated HTTPS/build outputs.
- Validation passed: `just test` (266 tests), `just check`, `just build`, and `just lint`; committed/pushed `fcda71b feat(upload): add upload status panel`; repo clean/up-to-date.
- **Next:** pick `mibilioteca-9fo` (scan management UI) for user flow, or `mibilioteca-1bp` if continuing IMU/motion-quality work.

---

## 2026-05-07 10:03 — miblioteca

- Continued miblioteca scan-management work after Rule-of-5 review of the new code; fixed all findings in src/App.ts, src/scan/ScanManagementView.ts, src/tracer/mockScanApi.ts, and tests.
- Added app-level active-session resume before scan management, dev mock support for POST /api/scan/join, trimmed input validation, duplicate-create prevention, and success copy after creating a scan.
- Validation passed: just test (277), just check, just build, just lint; committed/pushed 18b5357 fix(scan): address scan management review findings after earlier 9ee4f3b feat(scan): add scan management UI.
- **Next:** pick a ready P2: mibilioteca-1bp (motionWindow extraction), mibilioteca-k56 (storage persistence/quota warning), or mibilioteca-19z (Android HTTPS verification).

---
## 2026-05-07 11:39 — miblioteca

- Continued `charly-vibes/miblioteca` with implement → Ro5U → fix → commit flow; completed `mibilioteca-1bp` and `mibilioteca-k56`.
- Added `extractMotionWindow()` in `src/sensors/imuTrace.ts` with 7-field IMU windows, malformed input guards, and tests; pushed `a064dfc feat(sensors): extract IMU motion windows`.
- Added storage budget protection in `src/pwa/storageBudget.ts` and `CaptureView`: request `navigator.storage.persist()`, sticky eviction warning, low-storage warning, and exhausted-quota capture block; pushed `3c02e7e feat(pwa): warn on unsafe storage budget`.
- Validation after both tickets: `just test`, `just check`, `just build`, `just lint` green; repo clean/up-to-date.
- **Next:** pick remaining ready work: `mibilioteca-19z` (Android HTTPS verification/follow-on backlog) or a P3 such as `mibilioteca-cxk` (missing-record no-op bug) / `mibilioteca-bzk` (preview upload).

---

## 2026-05-07 11:40 — dont

- Used Rule of 5 review results to fix evidence-locator issues in dont: symlink escapes, invalid line spans, term evidence audit projection, payload spec clarity, duplicate trace test attribute.
- Added regression coverage in tests/evidence_drift.rs and updated src/main.rs plus OpenSpec specs/archive state.
- Verified with cargo test --test evidence_drift, just test, and openspec validate --all --strict.
- **Next:** Review git diff/status, consider formatting policy (cargo fmt --check still reports pre-existing formatting drift), then commit the completed fixes.

---
## 2026-05-07 12:12 — miblioteca

- Completed Android HTTPS tracer-bullet verification (`mibilioteca-19z`): app works on Android Chrome (camera, capture, upload attempt); filed follow-on issues `ni0`, `uyq`, `o25`; added `android-verification.md` checklist and OpenSpec proposal description.
- Fixed `updateUploadState` missing-record no-op bug (`mibilioteca-cxk`): both `updateUploadState` and `updateUploadProgress` now throw on missing records; removed spurious `tx.abort()` calls that caused unhandled `AbortError` rejections.
- Implemented ghost overlay (`mibilioteca-iho`): `ghostOverlay.ts` (pure yaw integrator + focal-length pixel shift), `ghostOverlayCanvas.ts` (RAF loop with `translate3d`), wired into `CaptureView`.
- Completed capture viewfinder UI (`mibilioteca-g5y`): steadiness gate (accel → shutter disabled + red/green dot), quality warning badges (blur/exposure poll loop overlaid on viewfinder); 315 tests green.
- **Next:** pick remaining P2 `mibilioteca-ni0` (real backend integration) or P3s `bzk` (preview frame upload), `646` (iOS fallback), `o25` (upload reliability), `uyq` (multi-user join flow).

---

## 2026-05-07 12:14 — clojure-tutor

- Fixed nav-layer guard to allow F2 (non-printing) as leader for default/calva/emacs profiles — `g` was previously intercepted and broke typing; leader changed to F2 in `src/profiles/registry.js`
- Fixed which-key listener to use capture phase so vim doesn't intercept `p` as paste before the panel handler fires
- Routed F5 through CM6 `keymap.of()` in `emacs.js` so browser reload is prevented; noted GNOME Ctrl+Alt+Arrow as OS-level limitation (unfixable)
- Ran full Playwright MCP smoke test (6 screenshots): F2 → overlay, p → profiles panel, arrow nav, Enter → vim profile, fixture updates (`Ctrl-ArrowRight` → `>` / `barf-forward`), Space leader in vim — all pass
- Closed CLT-na9; `implement-profile-system` OpenSpec now 25/25; screenshots committed then removed + `*.png`/`*.mp4`/`*.webm` added to `.gitignore`; pushed to origin/main
- **Next:** start `scaffold-editor-shell` — 22 issues at 0%, mark OpenSpec task 6.3, run `bd ready` for first unblocked Phase 3 ticket

---

## 2026-05-07 12:23 — clojure-tutor

- User reconsidered Phase 2 mid-session (profile system felt like a nice-to-have); decided to wrap it rather than rip it out since it was 24/25 done
- Marked OpenSpec task 6.3 complete (browser verification via prior Playwright smoke test); archived `implement-profile-system` → `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-07-implement-profile-system/`
- Promoted three new specs into `openspec/specs/`: `keybinding-substitution`, `profile-system`, `which-key-nav`; added `.playwright-mcp/` and `playwright.config.js` to `.gitignore`
- Phase 2 now 25/25 complete; committed and pushed to origin/main
- **Next:** create beads issues for `scaffold-editor-shell` (22 tasks at 0%) and claim task 1.1 to start Phase 3

---
## 2026-05-07 12:43 — dont

- Confirmed rollout sequencing order: `add-ground-command` → `add-trace-query` → `improve-cli-ergonomics`; recorded decision in wai note and closed `dont-cw6`
- Archived `add-ground-command` openspec: checked off all 5 remaining tasks (1.1–2.2), ran `openspec validate --strict` (27 specs, all pass), promoted delta specs to `openspec/specs/`; committed and pushed
- `add-ground-command` is now fully complete; `add-trace-query` (2/7, 28%) is next in sequence
- **Next:** start `add-trace-query` — pull up remaining tasks and begin implementation

---
## 2026-05-07 12:42 — miblioteca

- Evaluated backend necessity — decided on bundle-first MVP: artifacts stay on phone, exported as `.mbibundle.zip` and shared via Drive/WhatsApp/email; backend deferred
- Created OpenSpec proposal `add-portable-bundle-export`; ran Rule of 5 review → fixed upload/export state conflict, aborted export scenario, sha256 checksum, filename format, storage thresholds, tracer acceptance slice
- Created 7 Beads tickets (j4x HITL approval → 6bo contract → kdj assembly + lfl error handling → 1el UI → u39 Android verification → 39j backend ingest decision)
- Ran issue-review skill → restructured dep graph: `lfl` no longer blocks `1el` (happy-path UI gates only on kdj); `lfl` gates u39 instead; added archive library prereq, stakeholder names, offline generation AC, exportState persistence-after-reload AC, verification result locations
- **Next:** unblock j4x (HITL approval from charly vibes), then start 6bo contract ticket to define `exportState` types and bundle manifest path generation

- Discussed and documented the OpenSpec Workspace view (Specs view should cover the whole `openspec/` workspace, not just current specs)
- Created change proposal `add-openspec-workspace-view` with `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, and spec delta
- Ran Rule of 5 review on the spec and applied all 8 findings (overlap resolution, edge cases, open questions)
- Created 8 beads tickets (atril-80y through atril-amw) with dependency chain
- Ran issue review and applied all recommended fixes: missing `atril-aca→atril-qnq` dep, description updates for bwg/amw/80y/4tc
- **Next:** Start implementation at `atril-80y` (reconcile overlap with `add-openspec-navigator` and `add-spec-change-cross-links`) — HITL decision needed before AFK work begins

- Approved HITL gate `j4x` (bundle-first MVP direction confirmed); closed ticket
- Implemented ticket `6bo`: defined `BundleManifest`, file entry types, and `exportState` in `src/bundle/types.ts`; deterministic filename/path generation in `src/bundle/paths.ts`
- TDD: wrote failing tests first, then implementations — 17 new tests, all green; full suite 332 passing
- Committed and pushed `feat(bundle): add portable bundle contract types and deterministic paths`
- **Next:** `kdj` — assemble and validate one-record portable bundle (zip up artifacts into `.mbibundle.zip` using types/paths just defined)

- Converted all 16 application source files from JS to Squint/ClojureScript (`.cljs`), keeping only the 4 boundary files (`main.js`, `storage.js`, `action-log.js`, `command-wrapper.js`) as plain JS per spec
- Fixed three export-leakage bugs discovered after conversion: `on_eval` in `shell.cljs`, duplicate `squint_core` import alias in `eval.cljs`, and 8 leaking `defn`s in `profiles-panel.cljs`
- App renders correctly on port 5173 with zero console errors; all 80 tests pass
- **Next:** continue with the `scaffold-editor-shell` OpenSpec (currently 0/22 tasks)

- Continued OpenSpec workspace view implementation after HITL decision that navigator/cross-link proposals should merge into the workspace view.
- Completed `atril-4tc`: added `projectDocuments` to `OpenSpecIndex` for root-level `openspec/project.md` and `openspec/AGENTS.md`, with unit tests.
- Verified 11 openspec-index tests and full suite: 352/352 green; committed as `62f8916 feat(openspec-index): add projectDocuments to OpenSpecIndex`.
- **Next:** Start `atril-bwg` — render the OpenSpec workspace overview on entry using the extended index.

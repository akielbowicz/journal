## 2026-05-05 15:16 — dont

- Completed tracer-bullet epic (`dont-9iq`): implemented all 10 phases end-to-end in one session
- Built Rust CLI with 6 commands (init, conclude, trust, dismiss, show, list), CozoDB datom store, envelope types, status lattice, and 7 integration tests
- Optimized `list_claims` from O(N+1) to O(2) Cozo queries; 75 tests passing, epic closed
- **Next:** check `bd ready` for newly unblocked work — likely label validators (`add-dont-define-label-validators`) or spec work (`dont-71y`, `dont-656`)

## 2026-05-05 15:31 — elegua

- Implemented `elegua/numeric/tolerance.py` (scalar tolerance types), `array.py` (array comparison with top-K diagnostics), `provenance.py`, and `verify_isolation` in `adapter.py`
- Rule of 5 review caught and fixed: ULP distance wrong for negatives (HIGH), NaN/Inf guard (MEDIUM), label mismatch silent failure (MEDIUM), plus 3 LOWs
- Implemented `elegua/numeric/layer.py` — `make_numeric_layer` LayerFn dispatching scalar/array/sample paths; registered in comparison pipeline as L3 via `NUMERIC_KEYS`
- **Next:** `elegua-jwox` (integrate top-K array disagreement reports with numeric layer) or `elegua-g5k7` (backwards compatibility tests) — both now unblocked

## 2026-05-05 15:32 — dont

- Ran 9 pending OpenSpec validations (all passed 23/23) and archived all 10 spec changes into `openspec/changes/archive/`
- Populated `openspec/specs/` with 21 canonical capability specs (2,527 lines); closed `dont-656` and `dont-71y`
- Marked `implement-tracer-bullet` tasks 3–41 complete, added missing test 10.4 (refusal loop end-to-end), archived the change; 76 tests green
- Created `openspec/specs/dont-build/spec.md`; `wai status` shows "all changes complete"
- **Next:** `bd ready` — all OpenSpec work for the v0.3.2 spec decomposition is done; check for newly created or unblocked implementation tasks
